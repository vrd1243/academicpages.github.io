I am a third year PhD student studying computer science at CU Boulder. Iâ€™m working with Prof. Liz Bradley, and my research interests are based around Topological Data Analysis. I am interested in applying Topological Data Analysis to a bunch of problems such as regimeshift detection in time series data, analysis of sunspots and understanding the behavior of bees. I have recently started applying deep learning methods to space weather data.

I live in Golden, Colorado. I am an avid reader, love road biking, and often head out to my backyard for a good climb.

I am on LinkedIn, and some of my project codes are on GitHub.
