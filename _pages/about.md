I am a third year PhD student studying computer science at CU Boulder. Iâ€™m working with Prof. [Liz Bradley](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~lizb/), and my research interests are based around Topological Data Analysis. I am interested in applying Topological Data Analysis to a bunch of problems such as regimeshift detection in time series data, analysis of sunspots and understanding the behavior of bees. I have recently started applying deep learning methods to space weather data.
