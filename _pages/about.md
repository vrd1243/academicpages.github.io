I am a fourth year PhD student studying computer science at CU Boulder. Iâ€™m working with [Prof. Liz Bradley](https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~lizb/), [Prof. Jim Meiss](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/jdm/) and [Dr. Thomas Berger](https://www.colorado.edu/spaceweather/thomas-berger). My general research interest is in applying tools from computer science and applied mathematics for understanding the dynamics of complex systems. My Ph.D. thesis is focused on developing data-driven solar flare forecasting models using Topological Data Analysis and Deep Learning. [Here](https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/2020/05/18/interdisciplinary-research-takes-new-approach-solar-flare-prediction) is a nice article describing highlighting my thesis. My interest in dynamics has led me to other interesting areas of research, such as [understanding the relationship between curvature and delay reconstruction of dynamical systems](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0005890), food distribution between honeybees, and characterizing scaling regions. 

In my spare time, I love to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29825333-varad-deshmukh), bike around Colorado and do Origami.
